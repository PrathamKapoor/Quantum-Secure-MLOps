Related work spans three areas: (1) MLOps for reliable ML deployment, (2) agentic AI for automation, and (3) energy forecasting in smart grids.

MLOps practices focus on automating the ML lifecycle, including data validation, model training, deployment, and monitoring [1]. However, traditional MLOps often lacks formal governance for safety-critical systems. Recent work introduces MLOps for healthcare [2] and autonomous vehicles [3], emphasizing model cards, provenance, and human-in-the-loop checks. Our work extends these principles to energy forecasting, adding quantum-secure cryptographic guarantees and deterministic agentic governance.

Agentic AI systems use LLM-based agents to automate complex tasks [4,5]. In ML, agents have been proposed for hyperparameter tuning [6] and pipeline orchestration [7]. However, unbounded agents risk unsafe actions in critical domains. We adopt the bounded agentic AI paradigm, where agents operate within strict policy constraints [8], ensuring that automation aligns with safety requirements.

Energy forecasting has evolved from statistical methods to ML and deep learning [9,10]. Renewable variability necessitates probabilistic and adaptive forecasts [11]. MLOps for energy forecasting remains underexplored; existing works focus on accuracy improvements rather than deployment safety [12]. Our system fills this gap by providing a governance-driven MLOps framework tailored to grid-integrated forecasting, where model integrity and action safety are paramount.
